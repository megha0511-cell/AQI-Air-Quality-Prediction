# 🌍 AQI Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning techniques.
It includes data preprocessing, visualization, feature analysis, and model training to estimate air quality levels.

The goal is to help understand pollution patterns and build a model that can predict AQI based on environmental factors.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the **city_day AQI dataset**, which contains air pollution data collected from different cities.

### Features include:

* PM2.5
* PM10
* NO2
* SO2
* CO
* O3
* Benzene
* Toluene
* Other air quality indicators

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

* Data loading
* Data cleaning (handling missing values)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data visualization using graphs
* Feature selection
* Model training and evaluation

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest (or your model — edit if different)

---

## 📈 Results

The model was trained to predict AQI values and evaluated using performance metrics such as:

* Accuracy / R² Score
* Mean Squared Error
* Visual comparison of predicted vs actual AQI

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Download the notebook file
2. Open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
3. Upload the dataset file (city_day.csv)
4. Run all cells
